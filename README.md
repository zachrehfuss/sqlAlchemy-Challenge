# sqlAlchemy-Challenge

Located in this repository are my two files of code, climate_starter and app.
There is also a folder titled resources that houses the sqlite file and 2
CSVs for the hawaii measurements and hawaii stations. Run the climate_starter code
in its entirety and then run the app file. In the app file, for the last two flask
routes, start and start end date, please be sure to input the dates in the following
format 2016-02-07. 2016 is for the year you want to look at, 02 is for the month you
want to look at, and 07 for the day you want to look at.

For developing my code, my classmates Matt and Duvoe helped fix my code for plotting
the bar graph. My professor Thomas and TA Joly helped fix the bin sizes for my
histogram to make it match the example code. Xpert learning assistant helped
fix my code for sorting the dataframe for the graphs and helped correct my
code for finding the most active station in the climate_start file. It also helped
debug my code for the third and 4th flask routes fixing my lists. Finally, my tutor
Brandon helped me with my code for returning the min, max and average temperatures,
as well as editing my list of API routes to add in line breaks.
