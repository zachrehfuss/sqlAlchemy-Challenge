# sqlAlchemy-Challenge

Located in this repository are my two files of code, climate_starter and app.
There is also a folder titled resources that houses the sqlite file and 2
CSVs for the hawaii measurements and hawaii stations. Run the climate_starter code
in its entirety and then run the app file.

For developing my code, my classmates Matt and Duvoe helped fix my code for plotting
the bar graph. My professor Thomas and TA Joly helped fix the bin sizes for my
histogram to make it match the example code. Xpert learning assistant helped
fix my code for sorting the dataframe for the graphs and helped correct my
code for finding the most active station in the climate_start file. It also helped
debug my code for the third and 4th flask routes fixing my lists.
